# Sample Description

Milk-ripening wheat straw was acquired from the experimental field in the west campus of China Agricultural University, May 24th, 2015. Paraffin embedding method was used around the middle of the second node above ground to prepare sample for sectioning[9] and deparaffined, freeze-dried sections supported over ZnS window for FTIR microspectroscopic chemical imaging


# File Description

Test.fsm – the infrared spectral image of sample above, the number of spatial pixel 282x165 (spatial resolution 6.25 μm × 6.25 μm), spectral resolution 4 cm-1, 8 co-add scans for each pixel, spectral region of 4000-750 cm-1 in transmission mode, obtained by the liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) line array (16×1 element) detector of FTIR microspectroscopic imaging system (Spotlight 400, PerkinElmer Ltd., Beaconsfield, bucks, UK)

Test.mat & TestWave.mat – the MATLAB format file converted from Test.fsm, respectively the spectrum data and the wavenumber data

Test.jpg – the visible micrograph of sample above with the same area as Test.fsm, obtained by charge-coupled device (CCD) camera of FTIR microspectroscopic imaging system (Spotlight 400, PerkinElmer Ltd., Beaconsfield, bucks, UK) 

ReferenceSpectrumCUTout.mat & ReferenceSpectrumFull.mat – the converted MATLAB format files of infrared reference spectrum by KBr pellets method, spectral resolution 4 cm-1, 32 co-add scans for each pellet, spectral region of 1800-800 cm-1(cut out after scan) and 4000-750 cm-1 in transmission mode, obtained by FTIR spectrometer (Spectrum 400, PerkinElmer Ltd., Beaconsfield, bucks, UK), in order of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, and starch.
